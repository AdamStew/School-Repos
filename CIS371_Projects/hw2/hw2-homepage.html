        I'm Adam Stewart.  I'm currently in my Senior year, enrolled at Grand Valley State University.  I'm studying
        computer science, with a math minor.  I'm currently a member in the Computing Club, Chess &amp; Go club, and
        Anime club.  My favorite movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457400/">Land of the Lost</a>.  My
        favorite tv show is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Avatar the Last Airbender</a>.
        And my favorite game of all time is <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/nintendo-64/paper-mario">Paper
            Mario</a> for the Nintendo 64.  Also my favorite color is green.

            <p>Satoru Iwata was a programmer for HAL Labratory, who made games for Nintendo.  Despite being a
                programmer, he stepped in and helped out wherever he thought was necessary.  He stepped up to a
                managerial position to lift his company from backruptcy.  Not only that, by while being president of
                HAL, he continued to step into productions that were falling behind schedule and do programming himself.
                Eventually he was promoted from being president for HAL to president to Nintendo.  Throughout his
                presidency, he always did what he thought would be new and groundbreaking to the industry.  Even in the
                toughest times, he refused to fire employees, instead taking a personal paycut.  Until even his last
                day, he was exchanging ideas with others. Satoru's work ethic and devotion is unmatched, and is an
                inspiration to all.</p>
