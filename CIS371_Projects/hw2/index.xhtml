        I'm Adam Stewart.  I'm currently in my Senior year, enrolled at Grand Valley State University.  I'm studying
        computer science, with a math minor.  I'm currently a member in the Computing Club, Chess &amp; Go club, and Anime
        club.  My favorite movie is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457400/">Land of the Lost</a>.  My favorite tv
        show is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Avatar the Last Airbender</a>.

            <p>Satoru Iwata was a programmer for HAL Labratory, which made games for Nintendo.  Despite that, he stepped in
            and helped out wherever he thought was necessary.  He stepped up to a managerial position to lift his
            company from backruptcy.  Not only that, by while being president, he continued to step into productions
            that were falling behind schedule and do programming himself.  Eventually he was promoted from being
            president for HAL to president to Nintendo.  Throughout his presidency, he always did what he thought would
            be new and groundbreaking to the industry.  Even in the toughest times, he refused to fire employees,
                instead taking a personal paycut.  Until even his last day, he was exchanging ideas with others.</p>
