1. How many cycles does it take to fill the pipeline? (Notice that DLXview labels the cycles beginning with zero. To avoid ambiguity, fill in the blank: "In DLXview, the first cycle during which all the pipeline stages are busy is labeled __4__.") 

2. How many cycles does it take for the computer to execute the first instruction completely? 
The first instruction is completely finished after cycle 4.

3. What pipeline stage is the instruction and r6, r7, r8 in during cycle number 5 (i.e., the cycle labeled 5)? 
It's in the accessing memory stage (even though this particular function doesn't need to access memory).

4. During which cycle does the the processor begin computing the instruction and r12, r13, r14? (Make sure your answer clearly states "the xth cycle" or "the cycle labeled x"). 
It begins computing this instruction on the 4th cycle.

5. During which cycle does the the processor finish computing the instruction and r12, r13, r14? (Make sure your answer clearly states "the xth cycle" or "the cycle labeled x"). 
It is completely finished after the 8th cycle.
6.
